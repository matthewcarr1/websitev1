          <h2>Trip Summary</h2>
          <p>
            In November of 2023, I went to go visit my friend Will in Christchurch, New Zealand. He was doing a post doc degree there, and offered
            to let me come visit. We started to plan the trip, which was going to be around 3 weeks for me. Unfortunately, Will had to work 
            so he was not able to join for the whole trip. We decided that we were going to hang out in Christchurch for a 
            a couple of days, then do the famous Milford Track together at the end of my trip. The rest of the trip, I was 
            going to spend solo traveling from hostel to hostel. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I had never travelled solo before and honestly was a little intimidated by it. That is why I decided to stay in hostels 
            for my trip. My goal was to try and be as social as possible when traveling solo. Thankfully New Zealand makes it super 
            easy to travel from hostel to hostel. I was able to book all of my hostels while I was on the move, never booking one 
            out more than a couple of days in advance. This gave me the freedom to spend as much time as I wanted in individual locations.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am hoping that this will be a tribute to all of the good times I had and all of the people that I met along the way. 
            This truly was a trip, where I learned more about myself by being alone, but also together with complete strangers,
             and it was freeing.

                  <h2>Christchurch</h2>
                  <p>In Christchurch, I explored the city including the botanical gardens and the earthquake museums. 
                    Will and I also would go up into the foothills to see all of the coastal views. Everything was so green 
                    because it was spring.

                    <h2>Arthur's Pass</h2>
                    <p>This was the first stop on my road trip. I rented a car and drove on the left side of the road
                      up into the mountains. On the way, I stopped at Scheffield Pie company which makes many types
                      of New Zealand hot pies. After getting to the hostel, I went on some very wet hikes in the rainforest.

                    <h2>Hokitika Gorge</h2>
                    <p>Hokitika was a nice stop between Arthur's Pass and Franz Josef. The photos is of a hike at Hokitika
                      gorge, which has some of the bluest glacial waters I have ever seen. Afterward, I went to go see a kiwi
                      at one of the wildlife refuge centers.

                  <h2>Franz</h2>
                  <p>I set aside 3 days to be in Franz Josef. One of the main things I actually did plan on the trip, 
                    was a tour to take me up on the glacier and go Ice Climbing (picture shown). This is also the stop where I
                    met a Scottish friend named Callum that was also on my tour. We ended up hiking afterward together and later
                    meeting back up in Wa単aka together.

                  <h2>Wa単aka</h2>
                  <p>This was one of my favorite places to stop on my trip. It was much less tourist ski town feeling
                    compared with Queenstown. Callum and I went out for drinks and had dinner. Early one morning, I also 
                    did a massive hike to the top of Roy's peak outside of the city for sunrise. This was one of the 
                    prettiest sunrises I have ever seen (pictured).

                  <p>I just had a chill day exploring the city here. It was nice that it was on the water, and there
                    were a lot of very close wineries, but it was VERY expensive. Only stayed one day here and then moved on
                    to start the Milford Track.

                  <h2>Milford Track</h2>
                  <p>My second favorite hike of the trip. This 33.4 mile track made for a 4 day backpacking trip between
                    huts. It was very nice at the end of the day to come back to a place to chill with friends. Will and 
                    two friends, Charlie and Liam, joined me for the world famous Milford track. It featured epic views
                    of glacial carved scenery

                  <h2>Mt.Cook National Park</h2>
                  <p>This was my favorite stop of the trip, even if I was the most exhausted at it. The weather turned out 
                    to be beautiful so I hiked up to a remote alpine hut called Sefton Bivy. A couple of alpinists I had met 
                    in Arthur's Pass had recommended that I stay a night up there. The "track" was steep, exposed, and grueling,
                    but it led me to the coolest place I have ever slept. I shared the 3 person hut with a couple of quirky
                    mountaineers.
